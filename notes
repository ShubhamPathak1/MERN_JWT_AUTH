here, generateTokenAndSetCookie is called in signup function,
i think it should be called only after verify email

think of lastLogin, is it actually needed? and is default case is needed in model

combine the verifyToken and checkAuth, as done by chatgpt

in frontend, in userstore, in signup userAuthenticated=true, i think it shoudld be only after verify otp
